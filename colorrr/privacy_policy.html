    <h1>Privacy Policy for Colorrr</h1>

    <p>Thank you for using Colorrr! Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our app.</p>
    
    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <h3>a. Images</h3>
    <p>When you select a black-and-white image, the app uploads it to our server for colorization. The processed colored image is sent back to the app and saved on your device.</p>

    <p>We may collect non-personal usage data to improve the app, such as crash reports and performance metrics.</p>

    <p>Colorrr uses Google AdMob to show ads in the free version of the app. AdMob may collect device identifiers and other data as described in Google's Privacy Policy.</p>

    <p>If you purchase the Pro version, we process payments through the app store (Google Play). We do not store any payment information.</p>
